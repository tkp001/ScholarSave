# Finance Tracking Made Easy for Students
### Made for my cooperative education project, inspiration from the lack of a mandatory financial literacy course at schools. It is important that students receive education on finance to thrive financially as the next generation of adults.


# Description

A financial management application that allows students to track their spending. Students can track expenses, income, debt/loan, set goals and do budgeting/saving. Additional tools are integrated for interest and currency exchange calculations. AI enhancement provides correction in transaction entries and serves as a learning tool for students interested in learning more about specific topics and provides suggestion on their current financial state.
